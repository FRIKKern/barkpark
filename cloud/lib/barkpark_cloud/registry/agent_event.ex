defmodule BarkparkCloud.Registry.AgentEvent do
  @moduledoc """
  One entry in a Barkpark's append-only agent event stream — the audit trail of
  what the on-box agent reported (a health beat, a status flip, a backup run, a
  TLS renewal). Belongs to one Barkpark.

  Append-only: there is `inserted_at` but NO `updated_at`. An event is a fact at
  a point in time; it is written once and never mutated. `payload` is a free map
  stored as jsonb, so each `type` can carry whatever shape it needs without a
  schema migration per event kind.

  # `content` is the onboarding signal: the on-box agent posts it once an
  # instance has ≥1 published document (payload carries `published_count`), so
  # the control plane can honestly derive the "published a doc" checklist step
  # without reading CMS content it can't see. See Accounts.onboarding_status/1.
