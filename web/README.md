# `web/` — Barkpark Vercel demo

Next.js (App Router) demo deployed to Vercel at the apex `https://barkpark.cloud`. Read-only consumer of the Phoenix API at `https://api.barkpark.cloud`. Lists published posts from the `production` dataset.

This replaces the prior `apps/demo/` Next.js project (retired in the same PR — see Task #27 plan §Phase 1).

## Run locally

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The page reads from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. Defaults to `http://localhost:4000` if unset (matches a local `mix phx.server`).

```bash
# Hit the live API instead of local Phoenix
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.barkpark.cloud pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — the index page lists published posts.

Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local` to pin local values; `.env.local` is gitignored (only `.env.example` is committed, see `.gitignore`).

## SDK

This project uses two pinned `@barkpark/*` packages — both at exact `1.0.0-preview.2` (no caret, no tilde) so the demo is locked off a moving preview API surface:

| Package | Used for |
|---------|----------|
| `@barkpark/core` | Runtime-agnostic HTTP client (`createClient`, `client.docs(type).find()`). Phase 1 demo uses this directly for public reads of `perspective=published`. |
| `@barkpark/nextjs` | App Router integration — `createBarkparkServer`, `BarkparkLive`, draft-mode routes, webhook handler. **Installed and ready** for Phase 5+ wiring of preview / live updates. The Phase 1 demo does NOT call into it yet. |

`lib/barkpark-client.ts` constructs the shared `@barkpark/core` client from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `dataset: "production"`, `perspective: "published"`.

### Rolling back to a vendored thin client

If the SDK preview ships a breaking change before this app reaches GA, the rollback is mechanical:

```bash
cd web
pnpm remove @barkpark/core @barkpark/nextjs
# Then write web/lib/barkpark.ts with three functions:
#   query(dataset, type, opts?), doc(dataset, type, id), mutate(dataset, mutations[])
# Each is ~20 lines of `fetch` against `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/v1/data/...`.
```

The plan default for Task #27 was a vendored thin client; we chose the published SDK because it was on npm with `latest` and `preview` dist-tags both pinned to `1.0.0-preview.2`.

## Deploying to Vercel

The Vercel project (`guerrilla/demo`) builds from this directory — see root `vercel.json` and Phase 3 of the Task #27 plan. Production env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.barkpark.cloud`.

Phase 2 of Task #27 must add `https://barkpark.cloud` (and the Vercel preview wildcard) to Phoenix's `check_origin` and per-dataset `cors_origins` allowlists before browser-side `fetch` from this app will work without CORS errors. Server-rendered pages (this demo today) talk to the API server-to-server and are not affected by `check_origin`, but client-side hooks added later will be.

## Files

- `app/page.tsx` — Server Component, fetches published posts and renders `title + slug` list.
- `lib/barkpark-client.ts` — `@barkpark/core` client bound to `production` / `published` from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- `.env.example` — copy to `.env.local` for local dev.
